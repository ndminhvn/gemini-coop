# Gemini Coop

Welcome to the Gemini Coop project! This is a monorepo containing multiple packages for building a cooperative chat application.

- Gemini Coop allows users to create mutual chat rooms, interact with AI bots, and collaborate in real-time.
- Each group chat can have multiple users and an AI assistant powered by Gemini, allowing for shared conversations and insights within the group.
